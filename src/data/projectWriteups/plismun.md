The former official website for the annual Park Lane International School MUN conference, in operation from 2018-2022. Information regarding the conference was available through this website, as well as providing a platform for prospective delegates, chairs and delegations to apply.

Park Lane International School Model United Nations (PLISMUN), is a conference where students aged 13 - 18 discuss topics of global importance by representing countries in a simulation of select committees of the United Nations. PLISMUN has welcomed 500+ students from over a dozen countries around the world to discuss pressing and relevant world issues.

## My role

For the inaugural edition of the conference, I designed, developed, and handled deployment of the website and application portal. This involved working closely with the other executive team members to coordinate planning details and project requirements. In subsequent editions, I maintained the codebase and worked with different executive teams to progress and grow the conference.
