A highly customisable and interactive Python simulation build over PyGame that models the orbits of celestial bodies in 2D space using Newton’s law of universal gravitation.

This simulation allows users to choose from several included preset planetary systems or create a simulation configuration from scratch, whether that be Halley's comet or visualising the three-body problem.

Precise positioning and movement vectors are obtained through built-in access to JPL’s HORIZONS system, a resource that provides precise data for objects in our solar system.


## Tech stack

**Python** 
- **Pygame** for simulation animation
- **Astropy** for computations and access to the JPL Horizons database


## Research applications

This simulation was used to generate data as part of my submission for the IB Physics HL Internal Assessment. By running dozens of simulations on a selected range of configurations, over 100k data entries were collected and analysed to model Kepler's laws of planetary motion to within 95% accuracy.
