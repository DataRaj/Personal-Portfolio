I created a custom static website to showcase my photography portfolio. The website is built with ReactJS and Typescript, and is hosted on Github Pages. ChakraUI was used to style the website and to provide components. 

The website is fully responsive and features custom image galleries for various categories of photography. The website also features a 3D globe displaying visited locations using Mapbox GL JS and e-commerce functionality using Ecwid.
